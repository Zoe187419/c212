\title{Implementation of a Two-Step False Discovery Rate for controlling the False Discovery Rate.}
\description{
Similar to the Double False Discovery Rate, the Two-Step method is designed to take advantage of possible groupings which may exist within 
sets of hypotheses. A threshold (defaulting to the Benjamini-Hochberg cut-off) is used to identify sets of hypotheses
which may contain significant hypotheses. It then groups these hypotheses together to form a single family and
applies the BH-procedure to declare hypotheses significant. With the default threshold the procedure is at least as powerful as the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.}
\usage{
%c212.2FDR <- function(trial.data, t_F = NULL, est = FALSE, alpha = 0.05)
c212.2FDR(trial.data, t_F = NULL, alpha = 0.05)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{trial.data}{
FIle or data frame containing the p-values for the hypotheses being tested. 
The data must contain the following columns: \emph{B} - the index or name of the groupings and \emph{p} - the p-values of the hypotheses.
}
  \item{t_F}{
Threshold value for determining if a group of hypotheses should be included in the final family. 
}
\item{alpha}{
The level for FDR control. E.g. 0.05.
}
}
\value{
The subset of hypotheses in \emph{file} or \emph{trial.data} deemed significant by the Two-step False Discovery Rate process.
